&lt;p&gt;We are makers who believe in simplicity, openness and effective designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Fabien Royer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Chief Hacker&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/Media/Default/People/FabienMedium.png" alt="Fabien" /&gt;
I grew up in France, in the western suburbs of Paris.
As a kid, I was fascinated by all things electronic, often taking devices apart to understand how they worked or putting together kits.
At age 10, I discovered computers and I knew right then that I wanted to become a programmer.
In 1980, my father bought a TI99/4A. A year later, I had created my first commercial video game.
Shortly afterwards, I was introduced to Bertrand by a common friend, marking the beginning of our lifelong friendship.
In 1985, Bertrand and I released F.R.E.E, a very ambitious adventure game for the Atari 800XL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years later, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, working as an IBM mainframe system programmer by day and
researching computer networks and security by night, making connections in the United States in the process.
In 1992, I moved to the U.S. where I worked on applications ranging from industrial motion control, data acquisition and process control systems,
to web development and web commerce tools.
I then designed a system and security monitoring product for Windows NT and co-founded a successful startup in 1997 until 2002 when IT spending dried up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2003, I started working for Microsoft, first on Windows Core Security, then Core Networking and finally, on the Xbox 360 and Kinect.
It is around 2007 that I discovered the Open Source Hardware movement and began teaching myself electronics and microcontrollers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011, I co-founded Nwazet with Bertrand out of passion for openness, creativity and bringing ideas to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bertrand Le Roy, PhD&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Director of creativity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/Media/Default/People/BertrandMedium.png" alt="Bertrand" /&gt;
I grew up in the suburbs of beautiful Paris where I enjoyed a happy, nerdy childhood.
At age 10, I got my first computer, a TI-99/4A.
Two years later, I self-published my first video game, and sold thousands of copies.
This is about the time when I met Fabien, the beginning of a lifelong friendship.
Together, we built an ambitious adventure game on the Atari 800XL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At age 20, I got accepted at
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Normale_Sup%C3%A9rieure_de_Lyon"&gt;École Normale Supérieure de Lyon&lt;/a&gt;
where I studied physics and mathematics and then got myself a PhD in Mathematical Physics (my thesis title was "Ternary Algebraic Structures").
After that, I decided that I had understood all the mysteries of the world (joking). Wanting to go back to computer stuff, I joined a small web agency
where I built what was probably the first CMS based on the nascent .NET platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft recruited me shortly after that and moved me and my family across the Atlantic to work on building the next version of ASP.NET.
During the eight years I spent there, I evangelized for the Open Source philosophy, participated in the adoption of jQuery
and founded the effort to develop the Orchard CMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011, I co-founded Nwazet with Fabien, with the goal of freeing our imaginations and materializing our ideas in alignment with our convictions about openness.&lt;/p&gt;

When you enter your credit card information, everything is encrypted through SSL, and your data is directly transmitted from your browser to the payment gateway. In exchange, the gateway is giving us back a one-time token that we then use to charge your card. The payment gateway is the only place where your credit card information exists (see &lt;a href="https://stripe.com/us/features#seamless-security" title="the Stripe web site"&gt;the Stripe web site&lt;/a&gt; for more information).
The only personal data that we store with your order are: the reference of the transaction, your name, your billing and shipping addresses, your email, phone number, the contents of the order, last 4 digits and expiration date of the credit card used, and a shipping tracker URL.&lt;/p&gt;
